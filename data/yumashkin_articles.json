At the time of writing, the second version of Python is still widely used, but judging by the changes that are taking place over time, it will remain only to run the old code. In our work with you, we will use Python 3, and in the future, if the word Python occurs somewhere, then it should be understood as Python 3. Python 2 applications will be specifically discussed.",
